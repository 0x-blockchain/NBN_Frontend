      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-12 col-xs-12">
          <h3 align="left">Privacy</h3>
            <p>We store personal information about you. Things such as name, address, phone number and billing history, these things enable us to contact you if necessary. We use your name and email address to send you newsletters. We use Google Analytics, it shows us how many people are visiting our site and what area they are visiting from.</p>
            <h3 align="left">Credit Card Processing</h3>
            <p>Your credit card information is stored and processed securely with <a href="https://stripe.com/au" target="_blank">Stripe</a>.</p>
            <h3 align="left">Piracy</h3>
            <p>Illegal activities are prohibited.</p>
            <h3 align="left">Hacking</h3>
            <p>By all means, hack as much as you want, just don't do anything illegal. Oh and, if you hack us, let us know of any vulnerabilities and if possible, how to patch them, there might be a reward.</p>
            <h3 align="left">Payments, Lateness & Debt Collection</h3>
            <p>The first months' payment will be charged to your credit card on the first day of activation and is calculated by the days left in that month. Each recurring monthly payment thereafter will be automatically charged to your card on the 1st of each month. You will also receive an invoice on the first of each month which will update its status to paid once payment is recognised.</p>
            <p>Those who miss the due date for a payment may receive reminders for the first 7 days via email. On the 8th day you will receive a reminder by email, SMS and phone call. On the 10th if you have not responded, the connection will be scheduled for disconnection after 30 days, meaning, at this stage, you have 30 days to clear up any misunderstandings and contact us to withdraw the disconnection. We will continue to pursure communcations with you during the 30 day period. After 30 days if we still have not been able to get in contact with you, you will receive a final invoice for the entire remaining contract period and your connection will have been disconnected.</p>
            <p>If for whatever reason your debt comes to a stage where we need to use a debt collector, you will be charged an additional 25% on top of your outstanding amount to cover the fees of the debt collector.</p>
            <h3 align="left">Refunds</h3>
            <p>We are not required to provide a refund if you change your mind about the services you asked for. <a href="refundpolicy.pdf" target="_blank">This</a> document created by ACCC outlines my refund policy.</p>
            <h3 align="left">Fair Use & Backhaul Policies</h3>
            <p>You must not breach the <a href="fair-use-policy-30-nov-11.pdf">NBNco Fair Use Policy</a> or other <a href="https://www.nbnco.com.au/industry/service-providers/agreements/wba.html">NBNco policies</a>. Also you must not breach the <a href="https://aapt.com.au/aapt-fair-use-policy">AAPT Fair Use Policy</a> or the <a href="https://aapt.com.au/acceptable-use-policy">AAPT Acceptable Use Policy</a>.</p>
            <h3 align="left">NBN Battery Backup</h3>
            <p>The supply of a battery backup system is apart of a standard NBN installation. Though you may ask not to have one installed. The ability to use a phone service to make or receive calls during a power failure, including calls to an emergency service number, depends on whether a battery backup is installed. During a power outage the power supply unit will beep once and switch to the battery backup. There is enough power in the battery to last around 2 to 3 hours. In the event of a power outage, the power supply unit will beep once and automatically switch to its backup battery power. Your corded telephone device will only work if it does not rely on mains power and is connected to a UNI-V port, for example, some cordless phones need continuous mains power to work, so be sure to select one that doesn't. Once the battery reaches 50% it will shutdown to preserve power, at that time you won't be able to make or receive calls. You can make or receive emergency calls by holding the battery emergency use button down for two seconds to turn the device back on again. Once the battery is empty you will no longer be able to make or receive calls to anyone including emergency service numbers. Once the backup battery goes flat you will need to purchase and replace it yourself.</p>
            <h3 align="left">nbn New Development Charge</h3>
            <p>In most cases an nbn installation is free of charge. However nbn may require a once off $300 installation charge. To find out whether this is the case at your address, please contact us or use the <a href="https://10mates.com.au/nbn-new-development-charge/">New Development Charge Checker</a>.</p>
            <h3 align="left">Contract Lengths</h3>
            <p>By entering into a contract with 10MATES you agree to and understand the terms on this page 10mates.com.au/terms. Contracts are binding for 12 months or 24 months for those who choose a bonus.</p>
            <h3 align="left">Relocations and Moving House</h3>
            <p>Connections are made at a single address and cannot be moved to another, in other words, the contract is bound to a single address. Moving before the contract is finished would mean paying the remaining months in the contract. However if you find someone to take over the contract for the remaining months and they continue to pay the remaining months until complete then you would not be liable.</p>
            <h3 align="left">Disconnection Request</h3>
            <p>We require one month notice by email to alex@10mates.com.au Upon requesting a disconnection, the remaining term in the contract will be charged to your credit card.</p>
            <h3 align="left">Network Performance</h3>
            <p>Each plan has a maximum theorectical speed, also known as the advertised speed. Depending on the time of day and the speed of web servers' internet connection you are connecting to will determine how close the connection will come to reaching the maximum speed.</p>
            <h3 align="left">IP Address</h3>
            <p>By default you will be assigned a static IP address, however you many apply for more than one.</p>
            <h3 align="left">Port Blocking</h3>
            <p>We do not block any ports.</p>
            <h3 align="left">Principle Carrier</h3>
            <p>The principal carrier is AAPT.</p>
